                    <p>Physical activity can make you feel better, function better, and sleep better. Even one session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reduces anxiety, and even short bouts of physical activity are beneficial. 
                        Being physically active also fosters normal growth and development, improves overall health, can reduce the risk of various chronic diseases.

                    <h3>Go Green and Be Healthy</h3>
                    <p>Naturally green foods, especially leafy greens should top your good for you list of nutritious foods. Loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals (plant based compounds),
                       green foods are typically low in calories. This means you can eat them in abundance without worrying about packing on the pounds—as long as you don’t smother your healthy greens with butter,
                       fatty cheeses, or creamy sauces and dressings loaded with calories. <br><br> <a class="links" href="https://www.naturemade.com/blogs/health-articles/best-green-foods" target="_blank">Explore Further</a></p>

                    <h3>Physical Well-being in Golden years of life</h3>
                    <p>It is actually a myth that old age automatically means poor health. While old age can make adults more inclined to have health problems, it doesn’t mean they cannot put healthy preventative measures in place.
                        Recent research has found that lack of physical activity when we are older is resulting in half of the physical decline linked to old age.
                        Regular exercise has also been proven to provide cardiovascular benefits to people over the age of 50 and is a huge contributor to life longevity.

                    <h3>Why Use Medicines?</h3>
                    <p>Medicines are chemicals or compounds used to cure, halt, or prevent disease; ease symptoms; or help in the diagnosis of illnesses. 
                        Advances in medicines have enabled doctors to cure many diseases and save lives. Sometimes it seems like there are more medicines than there are diseases, and it can be hard to keep them straight. 
                        Some can be bought over the counter at pharmacies or other stores. Others require a doctor's prescription. Some are available only in hospitals.

                    <p>Practicing mindfulness and meditation may help you manage stress and high blood pressure, sleep better, feel more balanced and connected and even lower your risk of heart disease.
                        Meditation and mindfulness are practices often using breathing, quiet contemplation or sustained focus on something, such as an image,
                        phrase or sound that help you let go of stress and feel more calm and peaceful. Think of it as a mini-vacation from the stress in your life!

                    <p> Health checks can identify any early signs of health issues. When you have a health check, your doctor will talk with you about your medical history, your familys history of disease and your lifestyle, including your diet, weight, 
                        physical activity, alcohol use and whether you smoke. Your doctor may include a general health check when you visit for another reason. Your doctor can tell you how often you need health checks.
