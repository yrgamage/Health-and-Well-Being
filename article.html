								<p>organic food, fresh or processed food produced by organic farming methods. 
									Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, such as human-made
									pesticides and fertilizers, and does not contain genetically modified organisms
									(GMOs). Organic foods include fresh produce, meats, and dairy products as well
									as processed foods such as crackers, drinks, and frozen meals. The market for
									organic food has grown significantly since the late 20th century, becoming a 
									multibillion dollar industry with distinct production, processing, distribution,
									and retail systems.

								<p>
									As consumers increasingly prioritize health, sustainability, and ethical consumption, 
									the demand for organic food continues to grow. By supporting organic agriculture, individuals 
									can nourish their bodies with wholesome, nutrient-rich foods, protect the environment, and 
									promote ethical farming practices that benefit both people and the planet. Whether through small 
									changes in purchasing habits or advocating for policy changes that support organic farming, each 
									of us has the power to make a positive impact on the future of food and agriculture.
